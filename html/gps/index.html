<!-- Release 4: Reflect

1. Semantic tags have clearly defined/associated/attached meanings, which provide valuable information to other users
and anyone else looking at the code. Personally, I find header, footer, table, nav, and main to be the most useful.
I think article, section, and aside are less useful because those are less common terms.

2. I believe the browser simply displays elements in the order that they appear in the HTML code.

3. I learned how you can customize Sublime through snippets. Kind of reminds me of Macros in Excel. Yes, I think I 
will create handy snippets in the future. For example, I can see the usefulness of a snippet that quickly creates
the structure of a table, rather than needing to remember and/or retype it each time.

4. My partner and I took a long time trying to figure out snippets, especially concerning which directory they are
placed in. I could improve my understanding by practicing more. However, I am unsure to what degree snippets are allowed
or encouraged for coursework. In particular, since snippets are placed in a separate directory, what is the best
way to submit such work?
