<p>Savannah cats are even <strong>better</strong> than normal cats for <em>several</em> reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are affectionate and social animals! They are often said to be "dog-like" in their loyalty and temperament.</li>
<li>They are ninja-like athletes! From a standing position, they can easily leap 8 or more feet!</li>
<li>You get the best of both worlds! They can use a litter box, can be harness-trained to walk on a leash, and they can learn to play fetch.</li>
</ol>
