# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a method to track changes between collaborators. It allows you to establish save points that you can revert back to. You can easily identify who has made what modifications. It also makes it easy to backup, copy, create parallel versions, update, and synchronize your work.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a parallel line of development that may eventually converge with or diverge from your original master trunk. It allows you to make changes (without affecting your original) and you can then incorporate or discard those changes as you see fit. It also allows different people to work on the same project in parallel by creating independent branches for each of them. They can then push and pull any appropriate changes.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is the creation of a save point. You first determine which files you want to add (get a box ready for shipping) and then you eventually commit it (ship the box). A good commit message provides a detailed description of any new changes that have been made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is an issue that can occur when merging and that needs to be solved before proceeding. The most common situation is when both branches have modified the same file. In that case, you will need to specify which version to use. (It's kind of like when you copy over a directory but there is a file with the same name as an existing file. You then need to decide which version to use.)
